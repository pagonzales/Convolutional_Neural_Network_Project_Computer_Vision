# Convolutional Neural Network Project: Computer Vision/Image Detection Project
## Problem
A certain company wants to create an algorithm that detects whether or not the image is a Dog or a Cat. Using a Deep Learning Algorithm with Convolutional Neural Network Architecture, we will try to solve this problem.

## Project Objective
- To create a Deep Learning Algorithm that uses Convolutional Neural Network architecture to train a machine that can detect whether an image is a dog or a cat.
